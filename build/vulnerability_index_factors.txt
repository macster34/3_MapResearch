VULNERABILITY INDEX FACTORS
==========================

The vulnerability index is calculated using 5 factors, each weighted equally (20% each).
Higher vulnerability index = more vulnerable neighborhood.

FINAL CALCULATION:
vulnerability_index = (call_score + income_score + flood_score + community_center_score + church_score) / 5

FACTOR 1: JULY 311 CALLS (20%)
================================
- Higher calls = Higher vulnerability
- Normalized: call_count / 5000 (capped at 1.0)
- Logic: More emergency calls indicate more problems
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0

FACTOR 2: MEDIAN INCOME (20%)
==============================
- Lower income = Higher vulnerability
- Formula: 1 - (income - 20000) / (150000 - 20000)
- Logic: Lower income areas have fewer resources
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Income thresholds:
  * $20,000 or less = 1.0 (highest vulnerability)
  * $150,000 or more = 0.0 (lowest vulnerability)

FACTOR 3: FLOOD PLAIN COVERAGE (20%)
=====================================
- Higher flood % = Higher vulnerability
- Normalized: flood_percentage / 100 (capped at 1.0)
- Logic: More flood risk = more vulnerable
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Coverage thresholds:
  * 0% flood coverage = 0.0 (lowest vulnerability)
  * 100% flood coverage = 1.0 (highest vulnerability)

FACTOR 4: COMMUNITY CENTERS (20%)
=================================
- No center = 1.0 (high vulnerability)
- Small center (< 5,000 sq ft) = 0.7
- Medium center (5,000-15,000 sq ft) = 0.3
- Large center (> 15,000 sq ft) = 0.0 (low vulnerability)
- Logic: Community centers provide resources and support

FACTOR 5: CHURCHES (20%)
=========================
- No churches = 1.0 (high vulnerability)
- 1-2 churches with small area (< 50,000 sq ft) = 0.7
- 3-5 churches or large area (50,000-200,000 sq ft) = 0.3
- 6+ churches or very large area (> 200,000 sq ft) = 0.0 (low vulnerability)
- Logic: Churches provide community support and resources

VULNERABILITY SCALE:
===================
0.0 - 0.2: Very Low Vulnerability
0.2 - 0.4: Low Vulnerability
0.4 - 0.6: Medium Vulnerability
0.6 - 0.8: High Vulnerability
0.8 - 1.0: Very High Vulnerability

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
===================
Neighborhood with:
- 1,000 calls (score: 0.2)
- $80,000 income (score: 0.4)
- 30% flood coverage (score: 0.3)
- Large community center (score: 0.0)
- 5 churches with 150,000 sq ft (score: 0.3)

Total: (0.2 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.0 + 0.3) / 5 = 0.24
Result: Low Vulnerability

2. "Building code violation"
3. "Illegal dumping of trash"
4. "Vehicle nuisance - inoperable vehicle"

VALIDATION RESULTS
=================

AUTOMATED CATEGORIZATION ACCURACY:
- Total cases found: 4,154
- Sample validation: 20 cases reviewed
- Accuracy rate: ~95% (based on sample descriptions)
- False positives: Some cases may be routine enforcement
- False negatives: Some nuisance cases may be missed

COMPARISON WITH OTHER MONTHS:
- June analysis: 4,154 cases
- July analysis: 3,546 cases
- August analysis: 4,327 cases
- June represents baseline before hurricane impact

STORM IMPACT ASSESSMENT
=======================

PRE-HURRICANE PERIOD:
- 4,154 nuisance & code cases during June 2024
- Hurricane Beryl had not yet occurred (landfall July 8, 2024)
- Cases represent routine property maintenance and code enforcement
- Standard city code compliance operations

TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:
- Baseline nuisance issues: June 1-30, 2024 (pre-hurricane period)
- Routine property maintenance and code enforcement
- Standard compliance and enforcement

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION:
- Nuisance & code issues occurred across all Houston service areas
- Standard distribution of code enforcement needs
- No hurricane-related concentration patterns

SERVICE IMPACT:
- Property nuisance was primary concern
- Code enforcement was routine
- Illegal dumping management was standard
- No hurricane-related nuisance and code crisis

CONCLUSION
==========

The June 2024 nuisance & code analysis represents the baseline period before Hurricane Beryl's impact. The 4,154 cases (10.0% of June requests) show normal property maintenance and code enforcement patterns with no hurricane-related nuisance and code crisis.

Key findings:
1. Property nuisance was the largest category (48% of nuisance cases)
2. No hurricane-specific code violations (hurricane not yet occurred)
3. Routine code enforcement and compliance dominated
4. Standard property maintenance was normal

This baseline data provides important context for understanding the nuisance and code enforcement impact that would occur in July 2024 when Hurricane Beryl made landfall.

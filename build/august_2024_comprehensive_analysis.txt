CONCLUSION
==========

August 2024 represents the recovery period following Hurricane Beryl's impact. The data shows ongoing cleanup efforts, infrastructure repairs, and service restoration. While the hurricane-related percentage (24.6%) appears high, only 11.6% of those cases actually mention storms, indicating that much of the activity represents routine city services rather than direct hurricane impact.

The recovery period shows a return toward normal service patterns while still addressing hurricane-related damage and cleanup needs. This provides important context for understanding the full timeline of Hurricane Beryl's impact on Houston's 311 services.

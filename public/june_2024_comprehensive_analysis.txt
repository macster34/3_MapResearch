STORM IMPACT ANALYSIS
=====================

PRE-HURRICANE PERIOD:
- June 2024 represents the baseline period before Hurricane Beryl
- Hurricane Beryl made landfall July 8, 2024 (not yet occurred in June)
- Storm debris cases likely from previous weather events (May storms, derecho)

STORM MENTIONS IN JUNE:
- Beryl mentions: 0 cases (hurricane not yet occurred)
- May storm mentions: 44 cases (previous weather event cleanup)
- Derecho mentions: 57 cases (previous weather event cleanup)
- General storm mentions: 1,639 cases (various weather events)

ACTUAL STORM-RELATED CASES:
- Total hurricane-related cases: 12,105 (29.1%)
- Cases with actual storm mentions: 1,639 (13.5% of hurricane-related)
- Routine cases miscategorized: 10,466 (86.5% of hurricane-related)

KEY INSIGHTS
============

1. MAINTENANCE WAS THE LARGEST CATEGORY:
   - 11,585 cases (27.8%)
   - Routine service requests dominated
   - Missed pickups and container issues were common

2. STORM DEBRIS WAS SIGNIFICANT:
   - 10,190 cases (24.5%)
   - Mostly routine debris collection
   - Some cases from previous weather events (May storms, derecho)

3. FLOOD & DRAINAGE ISSUES WERE NOTABLE:
   - 6,436 cases (15.5%)
   - Routine water infrastructure maintenance
   - Some cases from previous weather events

4. POWER OUTAGES WERE MINIMAL:
   - 1,915 cases (4.6%)
   - Mostly routine traffic signal maintenance
   - No hurricane-related power issues (hurricane not yet occurred)

5. TRAFFIC & INFRASTRUCTURE WAS MODERATE:
   - 4,337 cases (10.4%)
   - Routine street maintenance and traffic management
   - Standard infrastructure upkeep

6. NUISANCE & CODE VIOLATIONS WERE STEADY:
   - 4,154 cases (10.0%)
   - Property maintenance and code enforcement
   - Standard urban service requests

7. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WERE ROUTINE:
   - 3,014 cases (7.2%)
   - Dead animal collection and constituent services
   - Standard city operations

CONCLUSION
==========

June 2024 represents the baseline period before Hurricane Beryl's impact. The data shows normal city service patterns with routine maintenance, debris collection, and infrastructure management. The high percentage of "hurricane-related" cases (29.1%) is largely due to broad categorization logic rather than actual storm impact, as Hurricane Beryl had not yet occurred.

This baseline data provides important context for understanding the dramatic increase in storm-related issues that would occur in July 2024 when Hurricane Beryl made landfall.
